# Changelog

## 1.20.0

### Features

- **Kaltura Service URL region picker** — Login panel now offers a dropdown of Kaltura's 6 SaaS regions (US, Germany, Ireland/EU, Singapore, Canada, Australia) plus a "Custom" field for private cloud/on-premises accounts, instead of a single free-text server URL field.

### Bug Fixes

- **Removed a non-existent `*.kaltura.cloud` domain** from the manifest — leftover from an early spec that meant it metaphorically ("any Kaltura URL"), not as a real host. `requiredPermissions.network.domains` is now `"all"`, since UXP manifest permissions are static (install-time only) and Kaltura accounts can be on any SaaS region or an unpatterned private-cloud/on-prem URL.
- **Server URL now persists across relaunch** — `AuthService.restoreSession()` previously restored the KS and partner ID but not the server URL, so a user on a non-default region or custom domain would silently reconnect to the default US host on every relaunch and get bounced back to the login screen. The server URL is now stored and restored with the session.
- Removed the unused `webview` manifest permission.

### Documentation

- Rewrote `docs/architecture.md` to be generic for any organization — refers to "the Kaltura Service URL" rather than literal hostnames in prose and diagrams.
- Full i18n coverage for the new region picker strings across all 20 locales.

### Tests

- 495 tests across 40 suites — all passing

## 1.19.1

### Bug Fixes

- **Fixed SSO session refresh and expiry handling** — SSO sessions now correctly skip auto-refresh (the plugin holds no admin credential to mint a new SSO session) and parse the real expiry directly from the KS token instead of assuming a fixed TTL.

### Documentation

- Added an SSO setup guide for customer accounts; corrected the SSO token TTL description to note it's configurable per customer.

## 1.19.0

### Features

- **Replaced the broken SSO flow with the Auth Broker SPA Proxy flow** — SSO now collects email and an optional organization ID upfront and extracts the partner ID directly from the returned KS, simplifying the previous two-phase flow.

### Fixes

- Moved Partner ID entry to SSO Phase 1 and simplified Phase 2.
- Added `.nojekyll` to prevent GitHub Pages/Jekyll from parsing the SSO callback page.

## 1.18.2

### Bug Fixes

- **Fix panel layout not filling height** — UXP multi-panel `create(rootNode)` provides a container without `height: 100%`. Set height and overflow on rootNode so panels fill the available space with StatusBar pinned to bottom.
- **Fix "Replace Content" button not responding** — In Replace Existing mode, `handlePublish` had an early return if title was empty, but title is optional for replacements. Guard now only applies to New Entry mode.

## 1.18.1

### Internationalization

- **Full i18n support** — 246 translation keys across 20 languages (English + cs, da, de, es, fi, fr, it, ja, ko, nb, nl, pl, pt-BR, ru, sv, tr, uk, zh-Hans, zh-Hant).
- **Lightweight i18n system** — No external dependencies. React context + `useTranslation()` hook for components; `translate()` for vanilla JS commands.
- **All UI localized** — Panels, components, commands, settings dialog, error messages, filter labels, quality picker, and metadata editor.
- **Locale detection** — Automatically detects Adobe host app UI locale via `require("uxp").host.uiLocale`.

### Host App Support

- **Photoshop support** — Added `PhotoshopHostService` with `executeAsModal()` document open. Unique plugin ID (`163a7b84.ps`) so both .ccx files install side by side.
- **Removed After Effects and Audition** — No third-party UXP plugin support exists for these apps. Deleted host services, updated all configs and docs.

### Fixes

- **Fixed .ccx install conflict** — Each host app now gets a unique manifest `id` so installing one no longer overwrites the other.
- **Fixed manifest labels** — Premiere Pro v26 rejects `LocalizedString` objects on entrypoint labels; reverted to plain strings.
- **Marketplace icons** — Added 48×48, 96×96, 192×192 px PNG icons for Adobe Marketplace submission.

### Tests

- 488 tests across 40 suites — all passing

## 1.18.0

### Architecture

- **Multi-panel + command architecture** — Refactored from single tabbed panel to UXP best practices: two independent panels (Media Browser, Publish) and two commands (Settings, Sign Out). Each panel has its own React tree wrapped in `AuthGate` for inline login.
- **Shared singleton services** — Services moved from `App.tsx` `useMemo` to module-level singletons in `src/services/singleton.ts`. All panels and commands share the same `KalturaClient`, `AuthService`, and derived services.
- **Cross-panel auth sync** — Login/logout in one panel automatically syncs to all other panels via DOM events (`kaltura:signin`, `kaltura:signout`).
- **Settings as command** — Settings is now a command that opens a modal dialog via `uxpShowModal()` instead of a panel tab. No authentication required.
- **Sign Out as command** — Dedicated command in the Plugins menu. Clears session and dispatches signout event to reset all panel UIs.
- **Deleted `App.tsx`** — No longer the entry point. `src/index.tsx` registers entrypoints directly.

### Improvements

- **Quality picker overlay** — Renders as a proper absolute-positioned overlay with backdrop instead of inline (which caused layout overlap).
- **Removed `isImported` mechanism** — "Import to Project" always shown (no "Re-import" variant). "Attach to Clip" always available for entries with captions (not gated by import status).
- **Removed "Back to Browse" button** — No longer relevant since Publish is an independent panel.
- **In-panel headers** — Each panel shows a subtle header ("MEDIA BROWSER" / "PUBLISH") to distinguish docked panels since Premiere Pro uses the plugin name for all tab titles.
- **XSS prevention** — `escapeHtml()` applied to audit trail data rendered via innerHTML in SettingsCommand.

### Tests

- 493 tests across 40 suites
- New tests: SignOutCommand (event dispatch), singleton services, cross-panel auth sync

## 1.16.3

### Improvements

- **Single unified `.ccx`** — One `.ccx` file now works across Premiere Pro, After Effects, and Audition using a multi-host manifest. No more per-app downloads.
- **Simplified installation** — Download one `.ccx`, double-click to install, done. Removed all installer scripts (`install-mac.sh`, `install-win.bat`, `quick-install.sh`, `quick-install.ps1`).
- **Simplified release workflow** — GitHub Releases now publish a single `.ccx` asset.

## 1.16.2

### Features

- **eSearch for all browsing** — Replaced `media/list` entirely with eSearch (`elasticsearch_esearch/searchEntry`) for both initial browse and search queries. Uses `display_in_search=1` as default filter with `updated_at desc` sort for initial load.
- **Sort By dropdown** — Added sort options (Relevance, Recently updated, Recently created, Name A-Z, Most played, Last played) inside the "Filters and sort" panel. Auto-switches to Relevance when searching, back to Recently updated when cleared.
- **Visual search highlighting** — Search terms are highlighted in orange bold within entry titles in both grid and list views via `HighlightText` component.
- **Highlight snippets** — Search result hints now show the matched text (e.g., `title/tags: "PathFactory"` or `transcript at 1:23: "PathFactory integration..."`) instead of just "Found in title/tags".
- **My Content filter** — "My content" ownership filter uses structured eSearch OR across `kuser_id`, `creator_kuser_id`, `entitled_kusers_edit`, and `entitled_kusers_publish` fields, showing entries the user owns, created, or can edit/publish.

### Bug Fixes

- **Fix responsive UI overlap** — Login, Settings, and Publish panels now scroll properly when the plugin window is resized small. Uses `panel-scroll` layout pattern consistently.
- **Fix search box not rendering** — Replaced `<sp-search>` (unsupported in UXP) with `<sp-textfield>` for the search input.
- **Fix eSearch service name** — Corrected API service from `"eSearch"` to `"elasticsearch_esearch"` across MediaService and SearchService.
- **Fix highlight parsing** — Reads both top-level `highlight[]` and `itemsData[]` from eSearch response for complete highlight coverage. Fixed `stripHighlightTags` to handle non-string inputs.
- **Fix My Content highlight pollution** — Ownership filter items use `addHighlight: false` and proper AND/OR query hierarchy so highlights only come from the search term, not user field matches.
- **Fix eSearch field names** — Use valid `KalturaESearchEntryFieldName` enum values (`kuser_id`, `creator_kuser_id`, `entitled_kusers_edit`, `entitled_kusers_publish`).
- **Fix search precision** — Changed unified search from `PARTIAL` (itemType 2) to `STARTS_WITH` (itemType 3) for more precise matching.

### Improvements

- **Compact toolbar** — Sort dropdown moved inside the "Filters and sort" collapsible panel. Result count shown as a compact single line that's always visible.
- **eSearch query structure** — Properly structured as `AND[ OR[user fields], AND[search/filter fields] ]` per Kaltura best practices.
- **eSearch types** — Added nested operator support (`operator`, `searchItems` fields) to `KalturaESearchItem` type for sub-group queries.

### Tests

- Updated all BrowsePanel tests for eSearch-only browse (removed media.list mocks)
- Updated FilterBar tests for "Filters and sort" rename and sort dropdown
- Updated MediaService tests for query structure, ownership OR operator, `STARTS_WITH` item type, and highlight extraction

## 1.15.4

## 1.15.4

### Documentation

- **README audit against actual implementation** — removed REACH/AI captioning ordering claim (not implemented), fixed service counts (12 instantiated, not 13), removed unused NotificationService/ProxyService from project tree and service tables, removed WebSocket network requirement and UXP constraint (not wired up), clarified governance and offline cache descriptions

## 1.15.3

### Cleanup

- Removed internal strategy/research document (`Kaltura_Adobe_Premiere_Integration_Research.md`) from public repository

## 1.15.2

### Improvements

- **README rewritten for public release** — added "What is this?" intro for newcomers, prominent download link at top, reordered install instructions (manual download first, `gh` CLI second), added download table to release notes
- **Release notes install section updated** — matches new README ordering with clearer steps
- Removed hardcoded test counts from CONTRIBUTING.md (won't go stale)
- Fixed coverage threshold mismatch in README (branches 50%, not 52%)

## 1.15.1

### Bug Fixes

- **Fix SWC assertion crash on tab switch** — Switching from the Publish success screen back to Browse caused a UXP Spectrum Web Components `preCreateCallback` assertion (`false == true`) crash. Root cause: simultaneous SWC element unmount/mount during view transitions. Fixed with a two-phase tab switch that unmounts the current panel first, waits 50ms for SWC teardown, then mounts the new panel.

## 1.15.0

### Features

- **Image entry import** — Image entries (photos, graphics) can now be downloaded and imported directly into Premiere Pro. Previously showed "No ready renditions available" because images have no flavor assets. Uses `baseEntry/getDownloadUrl` API for direct source file download. (#82 related)
- **Transcript attachment to clips** — "Attach to Clip" button in the Captions tab connects Kaltura caption/transcript data directly to a video clip's project item using Premiere's native Transcript API. Captions appear in Premiere's Transcript panel for native caption workflow. (Closes #82)

### Dependency Upgrades

- **Jest** 29.7 → 30.3 — eliminates deprecated `abab`, `domexception`, `rimraf@3`
- **ESLint** 8.57 → 9.39 — migrated from `.eslintrc.json` to flat config (`eslint.config.mjs`); eliminates deprecated `@humanwhocodes/*` packages
- **copy-webpack-plugin** 12 → 14 — fixes high-severity `serialize-javascript` RCE vulnerability (CVE)
- **GitHub Actions** — `checkout` v4→v6, `setup-node` v4→v6, `upload-artifact` v4→v7, `download-artifact` v4→v8; eliminates Node.js 20 deprecation warnings

### Improvements

- Codebase review: replaced magic numbers with `ProjectItemType` enum, added `lockedAccess()` result checking
- Removed 23 unnecessary `eslint-disable-next-line` directives
- 8 new lessons documented in `docs/UXP_LESSONS_LEARNED.md` covering transcript API patterns
- Updated all documentation (README, CONTRIBUTING, CLAUDE.md) with current test counts and coverage thresholds

### Security

- Resolved 2 high-severity npm audit vulnerabilities (serialize-javascript RCE)
- npm deprecation warnings reduced from 10 to 4 (remaining are deep Jest/jsdom internals)

### Tests

- 452 tests across 37 suites (up from 442)
- New tests: `importTranscriptToClip` (7), `downloadAndImportEntry` (4), `downloadCaptionAsJson` (3), `parseKalturaJson` (3), `getEntryDownloadUrl` (1)
